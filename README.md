# Logistics_Performance_Overview

This project showcases a detailed logistics and supply chain perfomance dashboard,developed using **Excel** for data cleaning and **PowerBI** for data visualization.
It analyzes order fulfillment behavior,shipping trends,delivery statuses, and regional discounts across thousands of records gotten from a real-world supply chain dataset.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to gain insights into delivery efficiency,shipping timelines, and logistics perfomance across regions.
I wanted to track:

- How many orders were fulfilled?
- What percentage were delivered late?
- How do different shipping modes perform?
- How do actual shipping times compare with scheduled ones?
- Are there discount trends by region?

## Key Visuals and Metrics

|Visual|Insight|
|------|-------|
|Total Orders & Late Deliveries |Gives a quick summary of order volume and delay statistics|
|Delivery Status |Breakdown of late, early, on-time, and cancelled deliveries|
|Orders by Shipping Mode & Status |Compares delivery performance across different shipping types|
|Shipping Time Comparison | Shows difference between scheduled and actual delivery time|
|Regional Discounts |Highlights how discounts vary by order state|

## Data Cleaning Steps(Excel)

- I removed irrelevant or redundant columns(e.g duplicate IDs).
- I converted date columns to date format.
- I calculated new fields like processing time,monthly trends,delivery risk.
- Iremoved blanks and ensured consistency across product,region, and status fields.

## Key Insights

- **Over 35k** deliveries were late,which accounts for a significant percentage of total orders.
- **Standard Class** shipping had the highest number of late deliveries.
- There is a clear difference between scheduled vs actual shipping time in many months.
- Certain states received more discounts,suggesting location-based pricing strategies.

## Tools Used

- **Excel** - data cleaning,data formatting,custom fields.
- **PowerBI** - dashboard design,visualization,DAX measures.
