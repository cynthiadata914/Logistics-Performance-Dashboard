# Logistics_Performance_Overview

This project showcases a detailed logistics and supply chain perfomance dashboard,developed using **Excel** for data cleaning and **PowerBI** for data visualization.
It analyzes order fulfillment behavior,shipping trends,delivery statuses, and regional discounts across thousands of records gotten from a real-world supply chain dataset.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to gain insights into delivery efficiency,shipping timelines, and logistics perfomance across regions.
I wanted to track:

- How many orders were fulfilled?
- What percentage were delivered late?
- How do different shipping modes perform?
- How do actual shipping times compare with scheduled ones?
- Are there discount trends by region?
